# Issues With The Scoreboard

Hello there!

If you have issues with using the scoreboard app, please know that I would be happy to help fix them when I have time. Making apps is not my full time job, more of a hobby, but if you write down your issues [here](https://github.com/Romanmc72/r0m4n-scoreboard/issues) I will be notified and act on them as soon as I can. If you want me to act on them sooner, consider supporting me on Patreon or perhaps buy the app and source code off of me and/or publish your own better version. Those are your options. Have fun and don't take yourself too seriously!

## Things I cannot help with

- I cannot recover a scoreboard you deleted
- I cannot give you a private scoreboard
- I cannot help you find your scoreboard that you had but forgot the game code of (at least not easily)
- I cannot make it so others don't mess with your scores, perhaps get better friends
- I cannot drive stick shift (my dad never taught me)
- I cannot fly
- I cannot solve the climate crisis (but we are all trying I hope)
